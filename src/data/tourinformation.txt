An Unforgettable Industrial Tour (2025)
June 8-15, 2025
Get ready to dive into the story of my incredible 8-day industrial tour! From the busy streets of Manila to the cool mountain towns of Tagaytay and Baguio, this trip was so much more than just a school requirement. It was a journey packed with eye-opening experiences, a deep dive into Filipino culture, and moments that truly helped me grow as a person. Best of all, it brought me closer to my friends, creating memories and bonds that I'll cherish forever.
Part 1: Learning and History in the Heart of Manila
Day 1: A Rainy Start and Stepping Back in Time (June 8, 2025) Our big adventure kicked off on a Sunday morning, June 8, 2025, with a bit of a dramatic flair – it was pouring rain! I honestly thought our flight might be canceled, but luckily, it wasn't. We landed in Manila around 8:00 AM, and the city's warm, humid air greeted us, a big change from home. After settling into our dorm, grabbing some brunch, and getting a little rest, our afternoon city tour began. Our first stop was the famous Intramuros, Manila's old walled city. Walking on its ancient stone streets, seeing the old Spanish buildings, and touching the massive walls, I felt like I'd stepped back in time. It was amazing to connect with the Philippines' rich history. After that, we explored the huge SM Mall of Asia, a super busy place that gave us a taste of modern Filipino life and a fun, exciting start to our city exploration.
Day 2: Inside Foundever and Google's Inspiring Story (June 9, 2025) Day two, June 9, 2025, was when the real "industrial" part of our tour began. Our morning visit was to Foundever Philippines in Pasig City. Everyone there was incredibly welcoming, which made us feel right at home. The company's representatives gave us some really helpful talks about what it's like to work there, how you can grow in your job, and why it's so important to have a good work-life balance. These talks were super important for us, as we're all getting ready to start our own careers soon. We also got a tour of their offices, which helped us see what a real professional workplace looks like.
But the afternoon was truly a highlight: our visit to Google Philippines. The moment we walked into their bright, modern office, you could feel the excitement in the air. We were so lucky to hear directly from the President of Google Philippines. His story was incredibly inspiring. He talked about how his career path wasn't straight at all – he didn't even study his dream course in college and even went to law school for a while! But through all those changes, his love for technology never faded. In the end, he followed his true passion, and it led him to a top job at one of the world's biggest tech companies. His story was a powerful reminder that it's okay if your path isn't perfect, and that believing in your dreams, no matter what, can lead you to amazing places.
Day 3: Exploring the BPO World and Moments of Quiet Respect (June 10, 2025) June 10, 2025, continued our deep dive into Manila's diverse business scene. Our morning started early with a visit to Teleperformance Philippines, a huge company in the BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) world. Just like Foundever, they made us feel very welcome. The speakers talked a lot about how big Teleperformance has become globally and how they help their employees grow in their careers. They also explained all the different services they offer, like customer support and tech help for companies all over the world. They really stressed how much they care about work-life balance and creating a friendly, healthy place to work. We also got to tour their offices, which gave us a clearer picture of their daily operations. This visit really helped us understand the BPO industry better and what it's like to work for a big, international company.
The afternoon was a mix of quiet reflection and modern insights. First, we visited the Manila American Cemetery and Memorial in Bonifacio Global City (BGC). It was such a peaceful and respectful place. Seeing all the rows of white crosses, honoring American and Filipino soldiers who fought in World War II, was a truly humbling experience. It made us think about their bravery and sacrifices. After that, we headed to Kollab Philippines, a company with a very creative and modern feel. Their team talked about how important company culture is when you're looking for a job. They also discussed Artificial Intelligence (AI) and how it's changing the way we work today. One of the most useful parts was when they gave us tips on how to build a strong portfolio and how to present ourselves well in the professional world. They even gave us free food before we left! It was a fun and informative visit, full of good energy.
Day 4: Big Banks, Big Lessons, and "Always Keep Your Fork" (June 11, 2025) Day 4, June 11, 2025, was another big day, with visits to two very important organizations. Our morning began with the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Right away, we noticed how strict the security was and how incredibly clean and organized everything was. Our visit started with a tour of their small museum, where we learned about ADB's history and their mission to help improve lives across Asia through financial and development projects.
After the museum, we went to a large conference room. They kindly offered us free food and drinks before the program started. Then, several top professionals in technology and development shared their knowledge. They talked about exciting topics like innovation, sustainability, and how technology is shaping our future. Some of us even got to ask questions during a lively Q&A session, which made the discussions even more interesting. For me, the most memorable moment was getting the chance to present our project, RePay, to this important group. Standing in front of them, explaining how RePay works and why it matters, was both thrilling and a little scary. But I felt so proud to share something meaningful with such experienced people.
The afternoon took us to MicroSourcing, another well-known company in the outsourcing industry. We listened to their CEO, who gave us some truly valuable lessons. He stressed the importance of not just having skills, but also "soft skills" like good communication, teamwork, and genuinely caring about people. He reminded us that who you are as a person matters just as much as your talents in the workplace. We then had a tour of their offices, seeing their work environment firsthand. After the tour, they surprised us with J.CO Donuts and bottled water, which was a very welcome treat! One session focused on how to build a strong LinkedIn profile, which is super helpful for students and anyone looking for a job. Another speaker shared an inspiring thought that really stuck with me: "Always keep your fork." It sounded simple, but the message was powerful. It means that something good is always still coming, just like dessert comes after a meal. In life, even after challenges or hard work, better things are often on the way, so we should always be ready and hopeful. This visit was full of practical advice and inspiring life lessons.
Part 2: Fun and Exploration – Beyond the Office Walls
Day 5: Tagaytay's Cool Breeze and Roller Coaster Thrills (June 12, 2025) On June 12, 2025, which was also Independence Day, we celebrated our "freedom" by choosing to explore and relax in the beautiful city of Tagaytay. We woke up early, excited for a full day trip. When we arrived, the weather was amazing – cool and a little foggy, which only added to the charm. Our first stop was Sky View Park. Even though it was quite windy, we had a blast taking photos: selfies, groupies, and even a big group photo with everyone. We also bought some delicious local snacks and souvenirs to take home.
Later, at Sky Ranch Tagaytay, we had a fun picnic lunch right in the parking lot, enjoying our food before heading inside. Once in the amusement park, we tried all sorts of rides, from gentle ones to those that made us scream and laugh (and a few even made us dizzy!). A couple of our friends even got a little sick from the intense rides, but honestly, it just added to the hilarious memories. We took even more pictures, grabbed more snacks, and simply enjoyed the stunning views Tagaytay offered. By the end of the day, we were tired, our wallets were a bit lighter, but we were incredibly happy. It was a perfect break from all the company visits and an amazing chance for us to bond even more.
Day 6: Baguio's Strawberry Fields and Mountain Culture (June 13, 2025) After a long and fun day in Tagaytay, June 13, 2025, meant another early start. We left at 1:00 AM for a six-hour drive to Baguio. Most of us just slept on the bus, using the time to rest up. We arrived in Baguio around 6:00 AM, and the crisp, cool mountain air was so refreshing. Our first destination was the famous La Trinidad Strawberry Farm in Benguet. We walked around the farm, enjoying the fresh air, and bought lots of pasalubong like strawberry jams, handmade bags, hats, fresh fruits, and the must-try strawberry taho.
Next, we visited the peaceful Bell Church, a beautiful place with Chinese-inspired designs. We looked around, learned a bit about its history, and, of course, took many pictures. After that, we went to the Philippine Military Academy (PMA). We explored the large campus, observed the military surroundings, and took more photos. On our way, we also passed by The Mansion, another well-known landmark in Baguio. After a hotel lunch and a short rest, our adventure continued. We visited Mines View Park, where we enjoyed the cool weather and amazing views of the mountains and mining areas. We also had fun taking pictures with the big dogs and horses, and even tried on traditional Cordilleran costumes, which was a great way to learn about their culture. As night fell, we explored the lively Baguio Night Market. We tried different street foods and browsed through the popular ukay-ukay (thrift shops), where some of us found great deals on clothes and souvenirs. It was cold and tiring, but full of fantastic memories.
Day 7: The "Long Walk" and Saying Goodbye to the North (June 14, 2025) Our last day in Baguio, June 14, 2025, started with breakfast and a chance for us to explore on our own. My group decided to visit Burnham Park. We rented bikes and had a blast riding around, feeling like little F1 cars as we zoomed in circles, enjoying the cool air. While biking, we saw SM Baguio in the distance and thought it would be an easy walk. So, we started walking... and walking... and walking. We soon realized it was much farther than it looked! We joked that we got "scammed" by our own judgment, but in the end, it turned into a fun and memorable long walk. By 11:30 AM, we had to be back for lunch and to get ready for the trip back to Quezon City. We arrived at the dormitory around 6:00 PM. After resting a bit, we had dinner, then started packing and organizing our luggage for our flight home. It was a quiet night, filled with thoughts about the amazing week we'd just had.
Day 8: Homeward Bound, Hearts Full (June 15, 2025) The industrial tour officially ended on June 15, 2025. Early in the morning, before heading to the airport, we made a couple of exciting detours. We explored the modern Bonifacio Global City (BGC), taking in its impressive skyscrapers and vibrant atmosphere. Then, we visited the beautiful Venice Grand Canal Mall, where we felt like we were in Italy with its charming canals and gondolas. These last-minute adventures were a perfect way to soak in more of Manila's unique charm. After these memorable stops, we left our dormitory in Quezon City and headed to NAIA Terminal 2 for our flight back home. We carried all our bags, but more importantly, our hearts were full of new knowledge, incredible memories, and valuable experiences as we boarded the plane to Zamboanga City. The flight was smooth, but there was a little sadness in leaving behind the exciting week we had in Manila, Tagaytay, and Baguio. Even though we were tired, we were all incredibly thankful for the entire experience. This tour wasn't just about visiting places; it gave us real-world insights and moments we'll always remember, shaping us for the future.
Conclusion: More Than a Trip, It Was a Journey of Growth
The 2025 Industrial Tour was truly more than just a school trip; it was a grand adventure that helped me grow in so many ways. It gave me a real look inside different companies, showing me how they work and what's important in the business world. Beyond just skills, I learned how crucial things like company culture, "soft skills" (like talking to people and working in a team), and always trying new things are. The tour also offered practical advice straight from people who are already successful in their fields.
And it wasn't all work! The fun trips to Tagaytay and Baguio let us enjoy the Philippines' beautiful nature and rich culture. Those shared adventures and funny moments made our friendships even stronger. This tour proved that learning doesn't just happen in a classroom. It taught us about teamwork, how to dream big, and that life's journey is full of unexpected lessons. It was, without a doubt, an unforgettable experience that will stay with me for a long, long time.
