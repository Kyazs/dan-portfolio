## A Deep Dive into Manila's Business Scene

June 10, 2025, started early with a visit to **Teleperformance Philippines**, a giant in the BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) world. Just like Foundever, they made us feel very welcome.

### Teleperformance: Global Impact

The speakers shared how big Teleperformance has become globally and how they help employees grow. We learned about their wide range of services, from customer support to tech help for companies worldwide. Touring their offices gave us a real sense of the BPO industry's scale and energy.

**Highlights:**
- Global company culture
- Career growth and opportunities
- Work-life balance matters

### Manila American Cemetery: Honoring Heroes

The afternoon brought a change of pace. We visited the **Manila American Cemetery and Memorial** in Bonifacio Global City (BGC). The peaceful rows of white crosses honoring American and Filipino soldiers who fought in World War II left us humbled and reflective.

### Kollab Philippines: Creativity & Modern Work

Afterward, we headed to **Kollab Philippines**, a company with a creative, modern vibe. Their team talked about the importance of company culture, the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and how to build a strong portfolio. We left with new knowledgeâ€”and free food!

**Takeaways:**
- Company culture matters
- AI is changing the workplace
- Build your portfolio and present yourself well

### Reflections

Day 3 was a blend of business, history, and personal growth. We ended the day feeling grateful for the sacrifices of the past and excited for the future.
