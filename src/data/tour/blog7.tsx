# **Day 7: The "Long Walk" and Saying Goodbye to the North**

## *A Day of Adventure and Reflection*

Our last day in Baguio, June 14, 2025, started with breakfast and a chance to explore on our own. My group decided to visit **Burnham Park**. We rented bikes and had a blast riding around, feeling like little F1 cars as we zoomed in circles, enjoying the cool air.

### **The Legendary Walk**

While biking, we spotted **SM Baguio** in the distance and thought it would be an easy walk. So, we started walking... and walking... and walking. We soon realized it was much farther than it looked! We joked that we got "scammed" by our own judgment, but in the end, it turned into a fun and memorable long walk.

### **Farewell to Baguio**

By 11:30 AM, we had to be back for lunch and to get ready for the trip back to Quezon City. We arrived at the dormitory around 6:00 PM. After resting a bit, we had dinner, then started packing and organizing our luggage for our flight home. It was a quiet night, filled with thoughts about the amazing week we'd just had.

**Highlights:**
- Biking in Burnham Park
- The epic walk to SM Baguio
- Last night in the mountains

### **Reflections**

Saying goodbye to Baguio was bittersweet. The city had given us laughter, adventure, and memories to last a lifetime.
