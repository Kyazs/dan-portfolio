## **A Day of Learning and Inspiration**

Day 4, June 11, 2025, was another big day, with visits to two very important organizations. Our morning began at the **Asian Development Bank (ADB)**. Security was tight, and everything was spotless and organized.

<br/>
    <br/>

### **Asian Development Bank: Innovation & Impact**

<br/>

We started with a tour of their small museum, learning about ADB's history and their mission to improve lives across Asia. In a large conference room, we enjoyed free food and drinks before hearing from top professionals about innovation, sustainability, and technology's role in shaping the future. The highlight? Presenting our project, RePay, to this esteemed group—a proud and thrilling moment!

<br/>

**Key Moments:**
- Learning about ADB's mission
- Q&A with industry leaders
- Presenting our project, RePay

### **MicroSourcing: More Than Skills**

<br/>

The afternoon took us to **MicroSourcing**, a leader in outsourcing. Their CEO emphasized the importance of not just technical skills, but also soft skills like communication, teamwork, and genuine care for others. We toured their offices, enjoyed J.CO Donuts, and learned how to build a strong LinkedIn profile. The most memorable advice? "Always keep your fork." It means something good is always coming—stay hopeful!

<br/>

**Takeaways:**
- Soft skills matter as much as hard skills
- Build your professional profile
- Stay ready for good things ahead

<br/>

### **Reflections**

Day 4 was full of practical advice and inspiring life lessons. We left feeling motivated, hopeful, and ready for whatever comes next.
