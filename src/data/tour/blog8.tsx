## The Last Hurrah

The industrial tour officially ended on June 15, 2025. Early in the morning, before heading to the airport, we made a couple of exciting detours.

### BGC & Venice Grand Canal: A Taste of Modern Manila

We explored the modern **Bonifacio Global City (BGC)**, taking in its impressive skyscrapers and vibrant atmosphere. Then, we visited the beautiful **Venice Grand Canal Mall**, where we felt like we were in Italy with its charming canals and gondolas. These last-minute adventures were a perfect way to soak in more of Manila's unique charm.

### Farewell, For Now

After these memorable stops, we left our dormitory in Quezon City and headed to NAIA Terminal 2 for our flight back home. We carried all our bags, but more importantly, our hearts were full of new knowledge, incredible memories, and valuable experiences as we boarded the plane to Zamboanga City.

**Highlights:**
- Exploring BGC and Venice Grand Canal
- Last moments with friends
- Reflecting on an unforgettable journey

### Reflections

The flight was smooth, but there was a little sadness in leaving behind the exciting week we had in Manila, Tagaytay, and Baguio. Even though we were tired, we were all incredibly thankful for the entire experience. This tour wasn't just about visiting places; it gave us real-world insights and moments we'll always remember, shaping us for the future.
