    # Day 1: A Rainy Start and Stepping Back in Time

## The Adventure Begins

Our big adventure kicked off on a Sunday morning, June 8, 2025, with a bit of a dramatic flair – it was pouring rain! I honestly thought our flight might be canceled, but luckily, it wasn't. We landed in Manila around 8:00 AM, and the city's warm, humid air greeted us, a big change from home.

### **Intramuros: Walking Through History**
<br/>

Our first stop was the famous **Intramuros**, Manila's old walled city. Walking on its ancient stone streets, seeing the old Spanish buildings, and touching the massive walls, I felt like I'd stepped back in time. It was amazing to connect with the Philippines' rich history.
<br/>
<br/>

**Highlights:**
- Spanish colonial architecture
- Historic stone walls and fortifications
- Cultural heritage sites
- Educational walking tour
- Photo ops everywhere!

### **SM Mall of Asia: Modern Manila**
<br/>

After soaking in the past, we explored the huge **SM Mall of Asia**. The place was buzzing with energy, giving us a taste of modern Filipino life and a fun, exciting start to our city exploration.
<br/>
<br/>
**Mall Features:**
- One of the largest malls in the Philippines
- Stunning bay views
- Endless dining and shopping options
- Perfect for group bonding
<br/>

### **Reflections**

Despite the rain, the day was a perfect blend of history and modernity. Manila immediately struck us with its vibrant energy and rich culture. We ended the day sharing stories and laughter over dinner, excited for the days ahead.
