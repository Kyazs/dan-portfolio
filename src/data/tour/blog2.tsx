<br/>

Day two, June 9, 2025, was when the real "industrial" part of our tour began. Our morning visit was to **Foundever Philippines** in Pasig City. Everyone there was incredibly welcoming, making us feel right at home.
<br/>
<br/>

### **Foundever: Lessons for the Future**

The company's representatives gave us insightful talks about what it's like to work there, how you can grow in your job, and why work-life balance matters. These lessons felt especially important as we all prepare to start our own careers soon. Touring their offices gave us a glimpse into real professional life.
<br/>
<br/>

**Key Takeaways:**
- Career growth opportunities
- Importance of work-life balance
- Welcoming company culture

The afternoon was a true highlight: our visit to **Google Philippines**. The moment we walked into their bright, modern office, you could feel the excitement in the air. We were so lucky to hear directly from the President of Google Philippines.

He shared his inspiring story—how his career path wasn't straight at all. He didn't even study his dream course in college and went to law school for a while! But through all those changes, his love for technology never faded. In the end, he followed his true passion, leading him to a top job at one of the world's biggest tech companies.
<br/>
<br/>

**Inspiration:**
- It's okay if your path isn't perfect
- Believe in your dreams, no matter what
- Passion can lead you to amazing places
