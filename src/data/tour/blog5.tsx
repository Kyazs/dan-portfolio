## A Day of Freedom and Fun

On June 12, 2025—Independence Day—we celebrated our "freedom" by exploring the beautiful city of **Tagaytay**. The weather was cool and a little foggy, adding to the charm of the day.

### Sky View Park: Windy Wonders

Our first stop was **Sky View Park**. Despite the wind, we had a blast taking selfies, groupies, and a big group photo. We also bought delicious local snacks and souvenirs to take home.

### Sky Ranch Tagaytay: Thrills & Laughter

After a fun picnic lunch in the parking lot, we headed into **Sky Ranch Tagaytay**. We tried all sorts of rides—from gentle to wild! Some friends even got a little dizzy, but it just made the memories even funnier. We snapped more photos, grabbed more snacks, and soaked in the stunning views.

**Highlights:**
- Amusement park rides
- Group bonding
- Scenic views and cool weather

### Reflections

By the end of the day, we were tired, our wallets lighter, but our hearts incredibly happy. It was the perfect break from company visits and a chance to grow closer as friends.
