# **Day 6: Baguio's Strawberry Fields and Mountain Culture**

## *A Journey to the North*

<br/>

After a long, fun day in Tagaytay, June 13, 2025, meant another early start. We left at 1:00 AM for a six-hour drive to **Baguio**. Most of us slept on the bus, saving energy for the adventures ahead.

### **La Trinidad Strawberry Farm: Sweet Beginnings**

Our first stop was the famous **La Trinidad Strawberry Farm** in Benguet. We walked around, enjoyed the fresh air, and bought lots of pasalubong—strawberry jams, handmade bags, hats, fresh fruits, and the must-try strawberry taho.

<br/>

### **Bell Church & PMA: Culture and History**


<br/>

Next, we visited the peaceful **Bell Church**, a beautiful place with Chinese-inspired designs. After that, we explored the **Philippine Military Academy (PMA)**, taking in the large campus and military surroundings. We also passed by **The Mansion**, another Baguio landmark.

<br/>

### **Mines View Park & Night Market: Local Life**

<br/>

After lunch and a short rest, we headed to **Mines View Park** for cool weather and amazing mountain views. We took photos with big dogs and horses, tried on traditional Cordilleran costumes, and soaked in the culture. As night fell, we explored the lively **Baguio Night Market**, sampling street food and hunting for ukay-ukay bargains.

<br/>

**Highlights:**
- Strawberry picking and local treats
- Cultural immersion
- Night market adventures

### **Reflections**

It was cold and tiring, but the memories were fantastic. Day 6 was a true feast for the senses and the soul.
